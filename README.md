This Python program can take in a CSV file of elevation vlaues, generate a map from the points, and find the most efficient paths moving left to right starting from each point on the y axis.

## To-Do List

1. Compare the sum of each path that has been drawn and draw the overall most efficient path in a different color

2. Impliment argparse to add option commands. possibly color, file name, etc

3. Learn about optimization, expiriment with asynch compute. 

4. Find more ways to explore and add levels of complexity.
